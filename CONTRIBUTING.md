# Contributing to the Project

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Follow these guidelines to make the process smooth for everyone.

## 📌 General Guidelines
- Minimally use AI
- Follow the project's coding style and best practices.
- Ensure your changes are well-documented.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Keep pull requests focused on a single change.
- If you are refactoring and are not sure if the code is unused elsewhere, comment it out. It will be removed after the release.

## ✨ Code Standards
- Use **K&R** coding style for PHP.
- Follow best practices for Python and Bash scripts.
- Avoid unused functions and redundant code.

## 🔍 Pre-Commit Checks
Before committing, run the PHP syntax checker:
```sh
bash tools/php_syntax_check.sh
```
This is the same check that CI runs. You can also check a single file:
```sh
bash tools/php_syntax_check.sh src/domain/Device/EnigmaService.php
```
Do not submit PRs with syntax errors — CI will reject them.

<!-- ## 🧪 Writing and Running Tests
- Write unit tests for PHP scripts.
- To run tests:
  ```sh
  php8.4 /home/xc_vm/bin/install/php/phpunit-12.0.5.phar --configuration /home/xc_vm/tests/phpunit.xml 
  ```
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PRs. -->
